# Lazarus-Fortune-voronoi-with-binary-trees
This projects goal is to implement the Fortune triangulation algorithm in Lazarus as efficiently as possible. Both the beach front and the events priority queue are organized as balanced binary trees. The beach front deletion is non-recursive so that no parabola intersections occur during a point deletion. Timing on a relatively fast windows PC: one million points in about 3 seconds.
