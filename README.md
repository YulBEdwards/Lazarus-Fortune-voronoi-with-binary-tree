# Lazarus-Fortune-voronoi-with-binary-trees
This projects goal is to implement the Fortune triangulation algorithm in Lazarus as efficiently as possible. Both the beach front and the events priority queue are organized as balanced binary trees. The beach front nodes contain a global index that results in searching the beach front only once for each point added. Timing on a relatively fast windows PC: one million points in about 4 seconds.
