# Lazarus-Fortune-voronoi-with-binary-trees
This projectâ€™s goal was to re-implement in Lazarus the companion python Voronoi calculation. Lazarus, being a close kin of C++, provides a time efficient alternative to the interpreted python code. The Lazarus implementation has the same provisions as the code in python: both the beach-front and priority queue are implemented as self-balancing AVL trees. Included with this submission is output from the Lazarus program for 24 random points. The executable VTest shows a 50,000 point set of random points can be processed in less the 1/2 second.
